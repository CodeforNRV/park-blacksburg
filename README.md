Project to help find parking in downtown Blacksburg and the Virginia Tech campus

Current implementation programmed by the Spring 2017 HCI Capstone course at Virginia Tech.

### Tasks - TODO
-Move current kml files to permanent host
-As of 4-27-2017, the kml layers will sometimes not appear
-Sidebar menu is not fully function
-Mobile capability is currently not implemented


### Suggestions based on usability tests:
-Add a button to recenter the map
-Remove scrolling in website
-Change markers to have more meaning
-Add a “help” icon
-Include meter rates where applicable
-Refresh website every minute or two to update location
-Center search around current location
-After searching, lots/streets should automatically pop up
